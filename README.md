This tool is used to import all available data of bikesharing operators in the Netherlands. The data is plotted on a map, that can be found on https://openbike.nl. Making data available about the availability of bicycles is part of first phase of the development of an open standard for bike sharing https://openbikeshare.github.io/, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openbikeshare. 

This table shows which operators already have made data available.
