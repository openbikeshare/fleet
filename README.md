This tool is used to import all available data of bikesharing operators in the Netherlands. The data is plotted on a map, that can be found on https://openbike.nl. Making data available about the availability of bicycles is part of first phase of the development of an open standard for bike sharing https://openbikeshare.github.io/, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openbikeshare. 

This table shows which operators already have made data available.

\* Standard has yet to be determined. https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs is one of the considered options(maybe needs some improvements). If you have an idea for another standard please create an issue.

\*\* Maastricht is included. Dordrecht is missing

In this table are all parties included that did not sign the letter of intent for the development of the open standard, but do have data about the availability of their bicycles available.
